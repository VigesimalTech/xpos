# Cart Management

The cart is the central workspace of X POS where items are collected, quantities adjusted, discounts applied, and orders finalized.

## Adding Items to the Cart

### Click to Add
- Click an item in the grid/list to add it to the cart with a quantity of 1
- Click the same item again to increment the quantity by 1
- The newly added item auto-scrolls into view with a brief highlight animation

### Stock Validation
- Before adding an item, the system checks available stock in the POS warehouse
- If the item is out of stock and `block_sale_beyond_available_qty` is enabled (unset counts as enabled), an error message is shown
- If `allow_negative_stock` is enabled in Stock Settings, items can be sold even with zero stock, whatever the profile says
- Batch items check batch-specific quantities

### Customer Requirement
- A **customer must be selected** before adding items to the cart
- If you try to add an item without selecting a customer, an error prompt appears
- The customer selection is locked during return mode

### Special Item Types
- **Serialized items** — Each serial number creates a separate cart line item
- **Batch items** — The batch selection dialog opens before adding
- **Bundle items** — Product bundle components are expanded and tracked automatically
- **Variant items** — The variant picker opens for template items

## Cart Item Controls

### Quantity Adjustment
- **+/- Buttons** — Click the plus or minus buttons on each line item to adjust quantity
- **Inline Quantity Edit** — Click the quantity value to type a custom quantity directly
- **Arrow Keys** — Use Arrow Up/Down while focused on a quantity input to navigate between cart items
- **Minimum Quantity** — Quantity cannot go below 1 (use Delete to remove items)
- The quantity buttons and box are sized for touch screens

### Rate Editing
- If `allow_rate_change` is enabled in the POS Profile, the rate/price field is editable. The cashier's role also needs the **Change Price** permission
- With `allow_rate_change` off, no price field is offered, and ERPNext flags any changed price, whatever the role
- A price set below the price list counts as a discount against the cashier's **Discount Limit**
- Click the rate value to enter a custom price
- Arrow keys navigate between rate inputs of different cart items
- Rate changes are reflected immediately in the line total and cart summary

### UOM Switching
- Click the **UOM label** on a cart item to expand the UOM selector
- Select a different unit of measure from the available options
- The rate auto-recalculates based on the UOM conversion factor
- Example: switching from "Piece" to "Box (12 pcs)" multiplies the unit price accordingly

### Item-Level Discount
- Toggle between **percentage (%)** and **amount** discount per line item
- Enter the discount value — the line total updates in real time
- The POS Profile can set a `max_discount_percentage_allowed` to cap discounts, and each cashier has their own **Discount Limit**; the lower applies
- Line discounts need the POS Profile's **Allow User to Edit Discount** and the role's **Edit Discount Field** permission
- Cashiers choose the discount mode directly in the cart when editing a line item

### Delete Item
- Hover over a cart item to reveal the **Delete** (trash) button
- Click to remove the item from the cart
- No confirmation prompt — removal is instant

### Removing Items on the Desktop Till
- On the [Desktop Till](29-desktop-till.md), removing anything from the customer's sale needs the **Remove Items From the Cart** role permission, or a manager's PIN:
  - Deleting a line (its button or the Delete key)
  - Lowering a quantity to 0
  - Clearing the sale (the button, the shortcut, or **New Sale**)
  - Discarding a held order
- Lowering a quantity (above 0), raising one, free items added by a pricing rule, and lines in a return do not ask
- Every removal is recorded in the [Audit Log](31-audit-log.md), with the manager who approved it
- The web POS does not ask for approval

## Cart Summary & Totals

The cart summary at the bottom of the cart area displays a real-time breakdown of the order:

### Subtotal
- Sum of all line item amounts (quantity × rate) after item-level discounts

### Item Discounts Total
- Aggregate of all per-item discount amounts across all line items

### Tax Lines
Each tax from the POS Profile's Sales Taxes and Charges template is shown as a separate row:
- **Description** — Tax account name or label
- **Rate** — The tax rate percentage
- **Amount** — Calculated tax amount
- **Included indicator** — Shows if the tax is already included in the price (tax-inclusive pricing)
- Supports:
  - **On Net Total** — Percentage tax applied to item net amounts
  - **Actual** — Fixed tax amounts
  - **Per-item tax templates** — Items with their own tax template override the global rate
  - **Tax-inclusive pricing** — When `tax_inclusive` is enabled, taxes are back-calculated from prices

### Additional Discount
- Available when the cashier's role has the **Apply Additional Discount** permission
- Apply a **percentage** or **flat amount** discount to the entire order
- Toggle between percentage and amount using the mode switch
- Cashiers choose the discount mode directly in the discount panel
- Receipt output can still be formatted from the POS Profile using the `print_discount_amount` setting

### Loyalty Redemption
- If the customer has redeemed loyalty points, the deducted amount appears as a violet badge
- See [Loyalty Program](12-loyalty-program.md) for details

### Write-Off
- Small amount write-offs appear as an amber badge
- Useful for rounding adjustments
- See [Payment Processing](06-payment-processing.md) for details

### Grand Total
- The final amount due after all discounts, taxes, loyalty, and write-offs
- Taxes on a discounted sale are worked out as ERPNext books them: the discount lowers each line's net amount, and the tax is charged on that (see [Tax Handling](13-tax-handling.md))
- Rounding is applied unless `disable_rounded_total` is set in Global Defaults

### Multi-Currency
- If using a non-default currency, the conversion rate and currency symbol are displayed
- See [Multi-Currency](19-multi-currency.md) for details
